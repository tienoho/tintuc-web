Kate has an explanation for why that might persist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is about striving to do as well as possible, for yourself, not for outside approval; and not worrying excessively about mistakes or set-backs.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I am like a freight train. Working on the details, twisting them and playing on&nbsp;them over the years, but always staying on the same track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><cite>Valentino Garavani</cite></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>People who exhibit unhealthy perfectionism are fearful of failure, fearful of criticism, hate making mistakes, stew over past errors, and worry excessively about disappointing others. You can counter this by trying to develop a healthy perfectionist approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Forget Your Fears and Worries</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Success isn&rsquo;t about the end result, it&rsquo;s about what you learn along the way. Fashion fosters cliches of beauty, but I want to tear them apart. I wanted to dress the woman who lives and works, not the woman in a painting. For me, the summer will be pure gray &ndash; <strong><a href=\"#\">mother-of-pearl gray</a></strong>, very pale gray.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I&rsquo;m used to always deciding everything myself.</li>\r\n	<li>It&rsquo;s a blessing, but also a terrible defect sensational.</li>\r\n	<li>Style is much more interesting than fashion, really.</li>\r\n	<li>Garbriela Peters partnered with YouTube.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Forget what people tell you is the right thing and go with what you love,&rdquo; Goodwin proclaimed. &ldquo;Make-up is supposed to be fun and if you are so attached to doing what&rsquo;s right it loses its joy.
