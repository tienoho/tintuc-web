I always say: To be well dressed you must be well naked. I am never satisfied with myself and that is what keeps me going &ndash; I have no post-satisfaction. The difference between style and fashion is quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Art is Concern for&nbsp;Learning and Living</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Possibly we&nbsp;do not have one theme for each season, but just try to make beautiful clothes all year round. We have <a href=\"#\">got to change our ethics</a> and our financial system and our whole way of understanding the world. It has to be a world in which people live rather than die; a sustainable world. It could be great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even Michelangelo got paid for doing the Sistine Chapel. To those artists who say they&rsquo;re doing it for the love of art, I say: Get real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">Nicole Kidman&nbsp;on the Critic&rsquo;s Choice Red Carpet Event of 2017</a></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"alignnone wp-caption\" id=\"attachment_91\" style=\"width:712px\"><a href=\"http://localhost/upload/images/pexels-photo-26138.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-91\" src=\"http://localhost/upload/images/pexels-photo-26138-1000x667.jpg\" style=\"height:469px; width:702px\" /> </a>\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion fosters cliches of beauty, walking in the streets of style.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to talk about fashion in the abstract, without a human body before my eyes, without drawings, without a choice of fabric &ndash; without a practical or visual reality. Brides today are increasingly sensitive to the tastes, feelings and finances of their attendants. Fashion is about dressing according to what&rsquo;s fashionable. Style is more about being yourself. If you wear clothes that don&rsquo;t suit you, you&rsquo;re a fashion victim. You have to wear clothes that make you look better. Art is about learning and about living with people. It&rsquo;s alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But ultimately, the main message is to forget about rules &ndash; after all, <a href=\"#\">one look at Stone&rsquo;s beauty history </a>proves she&rsquo;s tried everything from peacock blues to punchy corals and made it work for the red carpet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vanity is the Healthiest Thing in Life</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There were a lot of cut outs in the waists of gowns at the Critics&rsquo; Choice Awards and there were mostly chic and fun with a little peak of skin. This is not a little peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"alignleft wp-caption\" id=\"attachment_93\" style=\"width:300px\"><a href=\"http://localhost/upload/images/8536633539_d6251470db_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-93\" src=\"http://localhost/upload/images/8536633539_d6251470db_o-666x1000.jpg\" style=\"height:436px; width:290px\" /> </a>\r\n\r\n<p>Walking on the fashion show of Elementos</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>They will all come together to decide the winner of the prize, which was won last year by British menswear designer Grace Wales Bonner. The successful candidate will be given a &euro;300,000 grant and year-long business mentorship, helping them to develop every area of their brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Coverage:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"#\">50 Ways to Wear a Hat</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We like the idea of a long top over pants &ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s nervy &ndash;&nbsp;but the combo of no straps, very long layers of ruffling and her cleavage looking smashed the latest records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is reflected in the basic idea to Kate Ballis&rsquo; photo series Beaches Above. By shooting the world from a bird&rsquo;s eye view world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Success isn&rsquo;t about the end result, it&rsquo;s about what you learn along the way. Fashion fosters cliches of beauty, but I want to tear them apart. I wanted to dress the woman who lives and works, not the woman in a painting. For me, the summer will be pure gray &ndash; mother-of-pearl gray, very pale gray. To me, this is the big statement for summer. Then we have light blue, light turquoise, <a href=\"#\">lots of pink</a>. Women are more sure of themselves today. They don&rsquo;t have to emulate the way men dress.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. There is always the new project, the new opportunity.</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"alignnone wp-caption\" id=\"attachment_259\" style=\"width:712px\"><a href=\"http://localhost/upload/images/shutterstock_503388340.jpg\"><img class=\"size-main-slider wp-image-259\" src=\"http://localhost/upload/images/shutterstock_503388340-702x459.jpg\" style=\"height:336px; width:702px\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<p>A stylish purse for the La La Land.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Her pictures show the seaside of Brighton, Sandringham, St. Kilda and Albert Park in Melbourne. The photographs were taken from a Robinson helicopter with the door off: &ldquo;I hang directly out of the helicopter which is very scary but I&rsquo;m getting used to it,&rdquo; she says confidently. &ldquo;The photos were taken on a 40 degree day in Melbourne, which means that it&rsquo;s actually a nice temperature in the helicopter.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2.&nbsp;The idea of a beach holiday is a bit nostalgic in itself.&nbsp;To me, this is the big statement for summer.</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"alignnone wp-caption\" id=\"attachment_258\" style=\"width:712px\"><a href=\"http://localhost/upload/images/shutterstock_519772393.jpg\"><img class=\"size-main-slider wp-image-258\" src=\"http://localhost/upload/images/shutterstock_519772393-702x459.jpg\" style=\"height:336px; width:702px\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<p>Pulling off an awesome dress at outskirts.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>While from a ground level perspective the world often looks pretty messy, Kate&rsquo;s photos capture a certain order that lies within these landscapes. Her images can even be compared to paintings depicting life many years prior. Kate has an explanation for why that might persist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is about striving to do as well as possible, for yourself, not for outside approval; and not worrying excessively about mistakes or set-backs.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I am like a freight train. Working on the details, twisting them and playing on&nbsp;them over the years, but always staying on the same track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><cite>Valentino Garavani</cite></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>People who exhibit unhealthy perfectionism are fearful of failure, fearful of criticism, hate making mistakes, stew over past errors, and worry excessively about disappointing others. You can counter this by trying to develop a healthy perfectionist approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Forget Your Fears and Worries</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Success isn&rsquo;t about the end result, it&rsquo;s about what you learn along the way.
